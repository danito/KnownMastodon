 # KnownMastodon

Syndicate to Mastodon

Work in progress.

What's working:
- Posting Status to your Mastodon Instance.
- Posting a photo.
- Handles content warnings : use #cw as separator between spoiler text and status. Text will be split there.
- A photo with #nsfw in title will set to sensitive and one has to click to see it in Mastodon.

Admin page shows all Mastodon servers connected by the users.

What's not working yet:
- Share other than status or image.
- Add multiple Mastodon accounts.

Installation: save and rename `KnownMastodon` to `IdnoPlugins/Mastodon`
